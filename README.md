# AllTrails MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to AllTrails data, allowing you to search for hiking trails and get detailed trail information directly through Claude Desktop.

## Features

- ü•æ **Search trails** by national park
- üìç **Get detailed trail information** including difficulty, length, elevation gain, and descriptions
- üèîÔ∏è **Comprehensive trail data** from AllTrails including ratings, route types, and summaries
- ü§ñ **Seamless Claude integration** via MCP protocol

## Tools Available

### `search_trails`
Search for trails in a specific national park using AllTrails data.

**Parameters:**
- `park` (required): Park slug in format `us/state/park-name` (e.g., `us/tennessee/great-smoky-mountains-national-park`)

### `get_trail_details`
Get detailed information about a specific trail by its AllTrails slug.

**Parameters:**
- `slug` (required): Trail slug from AllTrails URL (the part after `/trail/`)

## Installation Options

### Option 1: With Virtual Environment (Recommended)

This approach isolates dependencies and prevents conflicts with other Python projects.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd alltrails_mcp
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```
python3 -m venv alltrails_mcp_venv
source alltrails_mcp_venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: alltrails_mcp_venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Verify Installation

Test that the server starts without errors:

```
python server.py
```

You should see the server start without crashing. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Claude Desktop with Pro or better subscription (MCP integration is only available in Pro)
- macOS (tested) or other Unix-like system

---

### Option 2: With System Python

If you prefer not to use a virtual environment, you can install dependencies globally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd alltrails_mcp
```

### 2. Install Dependencies Globally

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Verify Installation

Test that the server starts without errors:

```
python3 server.py
```

You should see the server start without crashing. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

## Claude Desktop Configuration

### 1. Locate Claude Desktop Config

Find your Claude Desktop configuration file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

If it doesn't exist, create a json file named claude_desktop_config.json in the above directory.

### 2. Add MCP Server Configuration

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

#### Option A: Using Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alltrails_mcp_server": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/alltrails_mcp/alltrails_mcp_venv/bin/python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/alltrails_mcp/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option B: Using System Python
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alltrails_mcp_server": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/alltrails_mcp/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Or with absolute Python path:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alltrails_mcp_server": {
      "command": "/usr/bin/python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/alltrails_mcp/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Replace `/path/to/your/alltrails_mcp` with the actual absolute path to your project directory.

### 3. Find Your Python Path

#### For Virtual Environment Users:
```
cd /path/to/your/alltrails_mcp
source alltrails_mcp_venv/bin/activate
which python
```

#### For System Python Users:
```
which python3
```

Use the output path in your configuration.

### 4. Install Dependencies

#### If Using Virtual Environment:
Dependencies are already installed in your virtual environment from step 3.

#### If Using System Python:
Install dependencies globally:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Restart Claude Desktop

Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can use these commands in Claude Desktop:

### Search for Trails

**By park name:**
```
Find trails in Great Smoky Mountains National Park
```

**By location:**
```
What are the best hiking trails in Yosemite?
```

**With specific criteria:**
```
Show me moderate difficulty trails in Yellowstone
```

**Using park slugs directly:**
```
Search for trails in us/california/yosemite-national-park
```

**For specific activities:**
```
Find family-friendly trails in Zion National Park
```

### Get Trail Details

**By trail name:**
```
Get details for Alum Cave Trail to Mount LeConte
```

**Using trail slugs:**
```
Get details for trail us/tennessee/alum-cave-trail-to-mount-leconte
```

**For planning purposes:**
```
I need detailed information about Rainbow Falls Trail including difficulty and elevation
```

### Combination Queries

**Search and get details:**
```
Find the most popular trails in Grand Canyon National Park and give me details about the top rated one
```

**Compare trails:**
```
Search for trails in Great Smoky Mountains and tell me which ones are best for beginners
```

**Trip planning:**
```
I'm visiting Yellowstone for 3 days. Find me a mix of easy and moderate trails with good views
```

### Natural Language Examples

The MCP server works with natural language, so you can ask questions like:

- "What are some good day hikes in the Smoky Mountains?"
- "Find me a challenging trail with waterfalls in Tennessee"
- "I want to hike to a summit with 360-degree views"
- "Show me trails that are good for photography"
- "Find dog-friendly trails in national parks"
- "What's the difficulty level of Charlies Bunion trail?"

### Common Park Slugs
- Great Smoky Mountains: `us/tennessee/great-smoky-mountains-national-park`
- Yosemite: `us/california/yosemite-national-park`
- Yellowstone: `us/wyoming/yellowstone-national-park`
- Grand Canyon: `us/arizona/grand-canyon-national-park`
- Zion: `us/utah/zion-national-park`

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Connecting

1. **Check the logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp.log
   ```

2. **Verify your config file:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

3. **Test the server manually:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/alltrails_mcp
   source alltrails_mcp_venv/bin/activate
   python server.py
   ```

### Common Issues

- **"Connection closed" errors**: Usually indicates a Python path or virtual environment issue
### **Path configuration issues**: Check that all paths in the config are absolute and correct
- **Import errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed in the correct Python environment (virtual environment vs system Python)
- **Python path errors**: Use `which python3` or `which python` to verify the correct Python executable path

### Debug Mode

For detailed debugging, check the MCP logs:

```
# macOS
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp.log

# The server also outputs debug information to stderr
```

## How It Works

1. **MCP Protocol**: Uses the Model Context Protocol to communicate with Claude Desktop
2. **Web Scraping**: Scrapes AllTrails website for trail data using BeautifulSoup
3. **Data Processing**: Formats and returns trail information in a structured format
4. **Tool Integration**: Exposes tools that Claude can call to search and retrieve trail data
